# Simple Interest Calculator

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

## Input:
- **p** - principal amount
- **t** - time period in years  
- **r** - annual rate of interest

## Output:
**Simple Interest = p × t × r**

## Formula Explanation:
- **Principal (p)**: The initial amount of money
- **Time (t)**: The duration for which the money is borrowed or invested (in years)
- **Rate (r)**: The annual interest rate (as a decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%)

## Example:
If you invest $1,000 at 5% annual interest for 3 years:
- p = 1000
- r = 0.05
- t = 3
- Simple Interest = 1000 × 3 × 0.05 = $150
